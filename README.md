# High-Performance 64-bit RISC-V ALU

## üöÄ Overview
This project implements a high-performance, 64-bit RISC-V compliant Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) with advanced capabilities including:
- IEEE 754-compliant floating-point arithmetic
- Vector processing unit (SIMD-style operations)
- Cryptographic acceleration modules (modular arithmetic and logical gates)
- Multiply-Accumulate units (MAC)
- Sophisticated branch prediction

Designed for ultra-fast datapaths on **7nm FinFET technology**, the architecture supports pipelined operation up to **2.5 GHz**.

## üìê Architecture Highlights

### ‚õìÔ∏è Pipeline Architecture
- 5-stage design (IF, ID, EX, MEM, WB) for high throughput
- Hazard handling and forwarding logic
- Separate datapaths for integer and floating-point execution

### üîß Core Components
- `alu64.sv`: Core ALU operations (ADD, SUB, AND, OR, XOR, SLT, shifts)
- `fpu.sv`: IEEE 754 floating-point unit (single & double precision)
- `vector_unit.sv`: SIMD-style operations
- `booth_multiplier.sv` + `wallace_tree.sv`: Fast multiplier pipeline
- `crypto_accel.sv`: Modular reduction and bit-wise crypto ops
- `branch_predictor.sv`: 2-bit saturating counter based branch prediction
- `exceptions.sv`: Overflow, divide-by-zero, and illegal instruction handler
